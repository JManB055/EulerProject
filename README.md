This is a repository of my solutions to the Project Euler archives.

I am programming in a c# console app using .NET Framework.

I am attempting to do these problems on my own while only looking up syntax. 
This is mostly for my own practice, so these may not be the most efficient solutions.

I am programming all of these in their own project, then uploading the main .cs files; this is multiple projects, not just one.
